# init vertx project - initial step

This step should get you familiar with:
* structure of the repository

1. The repository consists of multiply branches. Each them uses the following naming convention:
	``` {xx}-{title} ``` 
	Where `{xx}` is a step number and a `{title}` stands for a title of the step.
	All the branches contain some milestone in the tutorial. They are intended to be used as a reference 
	and a savepoint so that no matter if you are falling behind because of some obscure errors you can easly get back 
	on track and work with entire group. For now just leave those branches alone. This is close to converntion used by 
	all many spring tutorials.

2.  Each step (branch) consists of a readme file. The file consists of instruction for the step, describing
	its goal and a state that your own branch should be in after compliting the step. You can also find here 
	a bash script that contains all the commands run during the step and also sources required by the step.


3. If you are reading this README you should probably be located at branch 00-start, to jump to any other step, first 
	display branches:
	``` git branch ``` 
	and after that checkout your source to the selected branch:
	``` git branch {BRANCH_NAME} ```


	
4. Go ahead and type:
	``` git branch 02-vertx-init```
