# init vertx project - initial step

This step should get you familiar with:
* generation of vertx project using Maven/Gradle
* importing project to your favourite IDE

1. Copy repository from  https://github.com/wowasow/caseweek2016
2. The repository consists of multiply branches. Each them beside one uses the following naming convention:
``` step-{xx}-{title} ``` {xx} - step number, {title} - title of the step
All the branches named step* contains some milestone in the tutorial. They are intended to be used as a reference 
and a savepoint so that no matter if you are falling behind because of some obscure errors you can easly get back 
on track and work with entire group. For now just leave those branches alone. 
3. Start with an empty repository named ``` start ```
4.
